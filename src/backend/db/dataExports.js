        "I recently had the pleasure of working with Ryan on a full stack development project, and I must say that he is an exceptional developer. His technical skills are top-notch, and he consistently delivered high-quality code that exceeded expectations. Ryan also has great communication skills, which made it easy to collaborate with him throughout the project. He was always willing to listen to feedback and implement changes quickly and efficiently. One thing that really stood out to me about Ryan was his ability to think outside the box and come up with innovative solutions to complex problems. He was able to streamline processes and improve the overall functionality of the project, which resulted in a more user-friendly experience. Overall, Ryan is a talented and dedicated full stack developer who is always striving to improve and exceed expectations. I highly recommend him to any organization looking for a skilled developer who can deliver exceptional results.",

        "Ryan was the project manager on an app that our team of 7 designed and developed during our time at General Assembly. Ryan’s leadership and superior technical abilities were at the core of the project’s success. From the first day of the project he created a collaborative space for the team to share strengths and weaknesses, to learn from one another, and to create a product that we were proud of. His work ethic throughout the process was unwavering, even when the team’s momentum was interrupted by unexpected challenges. Ryan was able to deftly handle interpersonal issues that arose between team members in a way that did not distract from the team’s shared goal. Leaving GA, I consider Ryan to be one of the best resources that I have at my disposal as I start my career in software engineering."

          "I got the opportunity to work with Ryan on a project during my time at General Assembly. Ryan is without a doubt a FULL stack developer. I emphasize full because of the way he is able to think about an applications conception from start to finish on both sides. Simultaneously thinking about both the structure of models and how the information will then be displayed on the client side. Working with him has heavily influenced how I now approach my full stack projects. Technical abilities aside, Ryan also has many great qualities that make him a good leader or team player. He is organized, patient, a strategist, and articulates his ideas well."
